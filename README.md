# Prediction-Model-for-plasma-spray-process
In this project, we can predict the values of different parameters that affect the oxide content during the plasma spray process. 
This project was developed using the Python library Tkinter, which has a user-friendly interface. 
I have also added a section to the code of this project to create a new CSV file to record the predicted values so that we can train our model using these datasets in the future.
